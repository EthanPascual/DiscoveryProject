Setup:
in MongoCompass, delete any databases from 316 (cuz we used the same database id number)
create a new one and name it discovery
run command: mongod   in default directory for this project
this should connect you to that database

To run,
in server directory, run command: nodemon server.js
then, in client directory, run command: npm start
